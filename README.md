# Kraken-Bracket

## About
Whether it is for a local tournament or an organized tournament, __Kraken Bracket__ is meant to make tournament experiences smoother for tournament organizers, competitors, and spectators alike.

Registered users have the ability to create tournament brackets and/or events. From there, other registered users may sign up and participate in the brackets/events. Those who maintain brackets have the ability to update scores and move players in the brackets. Once a bracket is finished, the bracket's page will display the standings of all competitors, which is viewable for all users

All brackets support at minimum 4 players and at maximum 128 players

Events encompass a collection of brackets, so users can follow and be updated for all brackets within a single event.
